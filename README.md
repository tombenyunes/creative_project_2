## Description
Audio-visual 2D game that uses fluid dynamics as a gameplay mechanic.  

Fluid simulation influences the game world. It features premade scenes, a procedural mode, and a sandbox mode. It is physics-based and focuses on the emergence of beautiful visuals from natural phenomena.  

Technical features include: physics system, spring-mass system, scene serialisation, interpolated motion, fluid system, particle system, modular component-based architecture design for entities. It features a soundtrack and semi-procedural sound effects.  

Tech used included: C++, OpenGL, openFrameworks (creative coding toolkit), ofxMSAFluid (for solving fluid systems based on Navier-Stokes equations).
